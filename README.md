# Sign-language-recognition-using-deep-learning-ASL
Work in this project was to build an application to help the deaf and mute to communicate with other people easily to meet their needs and help them integrate into society. Through this application, the signal that the person puts in front of the camera is predicted and the corresponding letter is displayed in order to formulate a sentence that expresses what this person is saying.
